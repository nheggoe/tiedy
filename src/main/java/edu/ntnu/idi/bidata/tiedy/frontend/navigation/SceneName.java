/**
 * The Scene enum represents different scenes in the application. Each instance of the enum
 * corresponds to a specific user interface scene defined by an associated FXML file. The enum
 * provides the path to the FXML file as a URL for loading the scene in a JavaFX application.
 *
 * <p>Each scene is linked with a file name that determines the FXML file's location within the
 * resources folder. The file paths are formatted and resolved to URLs during initialization.
 *
 * <p>This enum is typically used in conjunction with a SceneManager class to switch between
 * different stages or views of the application.
