 * Utility class for writing collections of objects to JSON files. The JSON files are created

 * <p>The class relies on a shared instance of {@link ObjectMapper} from the {@link JsonMapper}
 * class for efficient serialization operations. It creates the necessary directory structure before
 * writing the data if it does not already exist.
 *
 * <p>This class is designed for use with collections of objects and does not support writing
 * individual objects directly.
